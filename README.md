# 🛒 Shoplifting Detection System

A Computer Vision Project for Retail Security

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **Shoplifting Detection System** designed to
identify suspicious activities in retail environments using **Computer
Vision** techniques.\
The system processes surveillance footage and detects actions that may
indicate potential theft, helping retailers enhance their security
measures and prevent losses.

The deployed solution is currently operational and provides actionable
insights that improve monitoring efficiency and real-time threat
analysis.

## 🧩 How It Works

1.  The system takes input from CCTV or video files\
2.  Frames are processed and analyzed using a trained model\
3.  Suspicious actions are identified based on movement patterns &
    object interaction\
4.  Alerts or visual indicators are displayed\
5.  Outputs are used to support security decision-making
